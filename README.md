Developed by: Nu'aimman Dinie Roslan Ismani
/nSupervisor: Dr. Muhammad Daniel Hafiz Abdullah
/nAccessors: Prof. Madya Dr. Teh Noranis Mohd Aris and Dr. Syaifulnizam Abd Manaf

A Flutter app development project to fulfill FYP Requirements as a condition to be awarded Bachelor in Computer Science with Honours, UPM.

In my country, Malaysia, Malaysians tend to borrow and lend others money. Based on my research until October 2024, there is no application that have centralized both of the transactions tracking. Each of them may have tracking normal transactions, tracking budgets, and display graphs and summaries while another only tracking debts. So, I have a vision to build this app to integrate normal transactions and debt-related transactions. And now, here you are, this little basic applications that tracks both normal and debt-related transactions while
tracking budgets and showing graphs and summaries.

This project has successfully presented on 1400 hrs, on 27th January, 2025 at Bilik Mesyuarat C, FSKTM UPM. Thus, the maintenance of this project halted since this day. You are welcomed to improve this application and make it shine.

## Experience when Developing Project

1. Need to sure what kind of database that you want to use. A week wasted for finding the suitable database
   including reading documentation and testing the database.
2. Learn two ways to fetch data from database, Stream (for realtime) and Future (for non-realtime)
3. Learn the best way to code in inserting and reading DateTime datatype if use sqlite/drift:
   - When inserting, explicitly use toUtc();
   - When reading, explicitly use toLocal();
   (The code is finished before I realised this is the best way to do, learn from ChatGPT)
   (Now, I am really lazy to change it and I hope this feature would be implemented in future)
4. Try to not reuse the complex app from experienced developers. So exhausting for beginners to
   understand the source code even more if the source code is not commented. Better to develop it from scratch.
5. Please keep calm and try not to cry even the project is hard. Remember Allah, family and even the loved ones everywhere.
   Think that you very close to the top of the peak.
