# uruswang_money_manager_app

Developed by: Nu'aimman Dinie bin Roslan Ismani
A Flutter app development project to fulfil FYP Requirements as a condition to receive Bachelor in Computer Science, UPM.

## Experience when Developing Project

1. Need to sure what kind of database that you want to use. A week wasted for finding the suitable database
   including reading documentation and testing the database.
2. Learn two ways to fetch data from database, Stream (for realtime) and Future (for non-realtime)
3. Learn the best way to code in inserting and reading DateTime datatype if use sqlite/drift:
   - When inserting, explicitly use toUtc();
   - When reading, explicitly use toLocal();
   (The code is finished before I realised this is the best way to do, learn from ChatGPT)
   (Now, I am really lazy to change it and I hope this feature would be implemented in future)
4. Try to not reuse the complex app from experienced developers. So exhausting for beginners to
   understand the source code even more if the source code is not commented. Better to develop it from scratch.
5. Please keep calm and try not to cry even the project is hard. Remember Allah, family and even the loved ones everywhere.
   Think that you very close to the top of the peak.
